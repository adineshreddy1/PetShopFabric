# Script


## stage 1 - do it with geth

start up geth, dev mode with instant commit, rpc available on 5000 to match fab3
geth --dev --rpc --rpccorsdomain "*" --rpcport 5000



## stage 2 - do it with fabric
running fabric
docker peer logs
eth logs? 

truffle config to connect.

Adoption contract

truffle compile output

start truffle test
show truffle test

migrations js?
truffle migration, as "install to production network"



truffle goes to web3/fab3, which goes to evm, which goes to fabric





improvements:
explain demo, pet store tutorial
adopt a particular pet, transferring ownership of pet to invoker of contract.
as a txn

 - point of use the stuff you already have, and it runs on fabric.

future:
direct support of fabric by truffle? of the general purpose languages?

demo:
picked tutorial as we hope it is showing off truffle, you've probably seen it before.
